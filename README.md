# Pacifica Metadata Model

JSONSchema representation of the Pacifica Metadata Model

The JSONSchema we are using is Frictionless Data
(tabular schema)[https://frictionlessdata.io/schemas/table-schema.json].
This schema provides a good model for describing the
Pacifica Metadata Model and be language agnostic. With this
schema any piece of Pacifica software can dynamically use
the metadata model for whatever they need.
